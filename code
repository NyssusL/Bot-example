#Explanation for what I wrote.
#client.event is something we can't use as a user (It just happens) and client.command is something that we can use (<prefix> <command name>.)
#Basically 'async def <command name>(<args>):'
#: means that we wanna refer to what we typed before the ":".)
#I don't think I need to explain what await is, it's just kinda obvious.
#ctx(context).send("<Message>. That means, When ever someone is gonna run the bot's prefix and then the command name, the bot is gonna respond with the message your typed in the ().
